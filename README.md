# Home Credit Data Science Virtual Internship Experience

## Introduction

Welcome to the Home Credit Data Science Virtual Internship Experience repository. Here, you will find an in-depth analysis and modeling project to assess the risk of a person's ability to repay a loan on time. This repository showcases my work during this project, initially initiated in August 2022. As a beginner in data science at that time, I faced challenges, including file management and GitHub usage, leading to incomplete progress. However, with my continuous learning and experience gained over time, I am revisiting this project during my summer holiday to deliver a more refined and comprehensive outcome. With that in mind, I want to redo this project because I'm bored on my summer holiday. There are a lot of things that I learn here, and I'll be happy to share them with you.

## Background

The Home Credit Data Science Virtual Internship aims to predict individual loan repayment capabilities based on a range of features and variables. The project requires advanced data analysis and predictive modeling to develop a robust risk assessment framework.

## Goals

My primary objectives in this repository are as follows:

1. Reproduce and enhance the previous work done in August 2022 to reflect my improved skills and knowledge in data science.
2. Provide a detailed explanation of my approach to addressing the loan repayment prediction problem.
3. Share insights, challenges, and lessons learned during this project.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two main sections:

1. **My Work:** This section encompasses my efforts to tackle the loan repayment prediction problem. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
2. **Will's Work:** This section presents Will's approach to addressing the same problem. A comparative analysis of our methodologies will offer valuable insights into varied processes.

## Datasets

Please note that the dataset utilized in this project is substantial and exceeds GitHub's size limitations for repositories. To access the data, you can download it from Kaggle and place it in a folder named `input.` After downloading, unzip all the necessary files within the `input` folder to ensure smooth execution of the code.

Thank you for visiting this repository, and I hope you find the content insightful and informative.
